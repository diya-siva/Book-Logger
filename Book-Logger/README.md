# My Book Logger

My Book Logger is a flask web app that serves as a personal database for users to record the books they have read! Users are able to keep track of all their reads by recording certain key aspects of the book they had just finished reading. They can enter some basic information like the title of the book and its author(s). The user will also be given the ability to enter a rating on a scale of 1-10 for their book. The user can also enter a quick summary of their book. Finally, the user can enter any lessons or takeaways they had from reading the book.

This web app was created using a python backend framework: flask. The frontend was created using HTML and CSS along with Bootstrap. The database used to store the user credentials and post data was SQLite.
